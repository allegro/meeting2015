    abstract: 'Designing a coherent and good REST API is a hard and annoying stage of developing microservices and building the new API for Allegro Platform especially when it has to pass the "API Review" ;). We can do it better and without frustration. In the talk we will focus on design & prototyping a good API. I will talk about techniques and tools that support fast and flexible design (modeling) and testing RESTful APIs.'

    abstract: 'Hermes is a fast message broker recently open-sourced by Allegro. During the presentation I will explain when your events may not be delivered and what we have done to minimise this kind of situations. Besides that you will find out what we use to monitor events and how our approach to this subject has changed during last year. After we explain stabilisation issues we will delve into performance. I will answer questions like: how fast is Hermes? How many events/s and at what latency can be handled by a single Hermes instance? You will also hear about our failures and lessons we have learned from them.'

    abstract: 'Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) testing are usually mentioned as one of the solutions that might be used for testing microservices. We make the assumption that service interaction is based on light contracts and adhering to them assures that service remains interoperable. We will investigate how this approach works in practice by showing some examples of how this change in behaviour is implemented using various tools supporting Consumer Driven Contracts. We will compare the experience of using CDC with a different approach to integration testing, in which with support of some aliitional tooling we are able to test all the changes in production without any side-effect to end-users.'

    abstract: 'At Allegro we handle thousands of messages per second. These are clickstream (12k msgs/s), application logs (40k msg/s) and events sent between microservices (8k msg/s). We have created coherent, scalable system that delivers them to HDFS and ElasticSearch for further processing. Messages are transferred with low latency and stored in well-known format. At the end of the pipeline transferred data could be easily browsed and processed via many tools and frameworks (Kibana dashboards, Spark jobs, Hive Query Language, Hue web interface, Tableau and SQLDeveloper).<br />During the presentation we will describe architecture of our data hub. We will tell you about solutions we have used and problems we have challenged. We will also show how it has evolved over the past years. Finally we will tell few words about plans for the future.'

In this talk I will share my experience with Spark Streaming used to process the stream of Allegro users'' activities. I will also answer questions like: how to achieve required level of fault tolerance, is it possible to get exactly-once delivery guarantee, how to ensure reliable processing in face of latency spikes, how to deal with stateful processing, how and what to monitor on the YARN cluster, what configuration parameters are important and what alternative solutions we should consider.'

By saying SLA, we usually mean service availability and response time. Response time is not only business code, but also network latency and millions of small things in your application.
